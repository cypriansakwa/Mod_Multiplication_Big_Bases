This Rust program shows how to execute modular exponentiation and modular multiplication with the num-bigint crate, which handles large integers. 
The program computes the result of two modular exponentiations, multiplies the results, and then determines the modulus of the product.

The program performs the following steps:

1. Initializes three large integers: base, exponent, and modulus.
2. Calculates the modular exponentiation of each base raised to its respective exponent.
3. Multiplies the results of the two modular exponentiations.
4. Takes the modulus of the product to produce the final result.
